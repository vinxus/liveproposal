        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Ellipweb Solar Power is a company focused on the deployment of solar power systems in Nigeria. <br/>
        The company aims to improve the access to electricity for the average Nigerian. The company believes <br>
        solving the problem of power generation in Nigeria can serve to solve other problems such as reducing <br>
        pollution (noise and particulates) and solving the problem of poverty. The solutions will also help to <br>
        improve the overall health of Nigerians and hence enhance the productivity and economic growthof the country.
        </p>
        <p>To do the foregoing we have embarked on this project to roll out solar power generation systems using<br>
         a combination of credit provision and technical support to the consumers.</p>

        <p>We hope this proposal will convince you that all these could be done affordably and at a profit to the investors.</p>
