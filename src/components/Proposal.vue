                    text: `Ellipweb Solar Power is a company focused on the deployment of solar power systems in Nigeria. 
                                   The company aims to improve the access to electricity for the average Nigerian. The company 
                                   believes solving the problem of power generation in Nigeria can serve to solve other problems 
                                   such as reducing pollution (noise and particulates) and solving the problem of poverty. The 
                                   solutions will also help to improve the overall health of Nigerians and hence enhance the 
                                   productivity and economic growth of the country. <br/> To do the foregoing we have embarked on this 
                                   project to roll out solar power generation systems using a combination of credit provision and 
                                   technical support to the consumers.<br/>
                                   We hope this proposal will convince you that all these could be done affordably and at a profit to the investors.`
